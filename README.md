# ⚗️ Alkali Labs: Rare Earth Element Strategy from Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)

This project outlines a data-backed, sustainability-driven business strategy for Alkali Labs, a biotech startup pioneering **microbial extraction of rare earth elements (REEs)** from acid mine drainage. Developed as part of the Strategic Market Analysis module at Hult International Business School.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Alkali Labs** is positioned to disrupt the U.S. rare earth element (REE) supply chain by deploying modular, low-carbon extraction systems directly at AMD remediation sites. This repository synthesizes three deliverables:

- Market forecasts  
- Feedstock analysis  
- Tech feasibility  
- Customer segmentation  
- Supply chain modeling  
- National security alignment

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Assess the market potential for AMD-based REE extraction
- Compare AMD to e-waste and coal fly ash as viable feedstocks
- Evaluate Alkali Labs’ microbial extraction tech vs. traditional methods
- Segment high-value customers: EV OEMs, defense, wind energy
- Propose viable go-to-market models and supply chain roles
- Quantify revenue streams and permitting pathways

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Secondary Research** — U.S. DOE, EPA, USGS, and OEM policy briefings
- **Feedstock & Process Comparison Tables**  
- **CAPEX Modeling** — Site-based cost/revenue forecasts
- **Stakeholder Mapping** — OEMs, mine operators, water utilities
- **Infographic & Deck Design** — Business storytelling for investor-readiness

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Why AMD First?**  
  - Found at 5,000+ sites in the U.S.  
  - Easier permitting than e-waste or coal fly ash  
  - Predictable REE content (Ce, Nd, La, Y)  
  - Supports modular deployment & low carbon footprint

- **Target Customers:**  
  - General Motors, Tesla (EVs)  
  - GE, Siemens Gamesa (Wind)  
  - Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (Defense)

- **Business Models:**  
  - **Licensing Model** with remediation firms (e.g., Veolia, Montrose)  
  - **Offtake Model** for direct REE sale to OEMs

- **Strategic Fit:**  
  Aligns with IRA subsidies, national defense priorities, and ESG sourcing mandates

---

## 🌱 SDG & Impact Alignment

- **SDG 9:** Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure  
- **SDG 12:** Responsible Consumption & Production  
- **SDG 13:** Climate Action  
- **SDG 7:** Affordable and Clean Energy (enabling EVs and wind tech)

---
